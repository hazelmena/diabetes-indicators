This project aims to examine diabetes indicators using data sourced from a CSV file. The focus is on analyzing four key diabetes indicators to determine whether a higher or lower prevalence of diabetes is associated with these factors. By discerning such patterns, we can infer the likelihood of individuals developing diabetes in the future based on these specific indicators.
